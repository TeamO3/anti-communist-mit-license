### [READ LICENSE TEXT](./LICENSE)

---

I love Open Source, and I want to give my software away to as many people as
possible. However, I refuse to let my work benefit those who support communism.

If you are not a communist and don't actively support any communists, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about. I will not pursue any legal claims against
you, even if my license text is poorly written.
